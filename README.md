# Wint
Wint is a game I'm working on, I think its meant to be a very weird survival game taking place in a medival era, also with full on cities and stuff so I'm not sure why you wouldn't just live in one but I can work out story later. Currently in pre-alpha with getting all the base stuff made, which at 2021/15/8 consists of placing and creating structures, mob spawning, better fist combat, working chunks, and trading.
